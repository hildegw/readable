# Readable Project
Readable is a discussion board implemented using React-Redux. Any user can start discussions or comment on preset topics (React, Redux, Udacity). Users can up/down-vote posts and comments.

Readable project is implemented by me (hildegw) as part of Udacity Nanodegree. It showcases the use of React-Redux, and is a mandatory requirement to pass Udacity React nanondegree.


## Installing and running the project
Download the zip-file and unpack. Go to directory where application was unpacked.
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* go to api-server directory and start the server with `node server`
* start the application with `npm start` from application directory


## Server API
The application connects to 'http://localhost:3001'

Please refer to the server readme file for detailed information on the API:

## Limitations
Currently, no user management is implemented. I.e. any user can add, update, or delete posts and comments.
